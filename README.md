# vue-login-facebook-gmail

## Stack
```
- Vue 2
- Vuex
- Vuetify
- vuex-persistedstate
- secure-ls ( for encrypting localstorage )
- Firebase ( auth with Gmail and Facebook, Firesotare and Database )

## Note:

There is a problem. When I get data from Facebook, I can't get user's profile photo.
This only happens with Facebook, because when I get data from Gmail, everything it's ok.
If you can fix this, please, just send a pull request! 

Thanks !
